Queen's Gambit is a visualisation tool for solving the N-Queens problem using a backtracking algorithm. The N-Queens problem involves placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This project allows you to interactively explore and visualize solutions to the N-Queens problem.

## Features

- **Interactive UI:** Adjust the number of queens and visualize solutions.
- **Backtracking Algorithm:** Find all possible solutions.
- **Slider for Speed:** Adjust visualization speed.
- **Responsive Design:** Works well on various screen sizes.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and open `index.html` in your web browser.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/queens-gambit.git
cd queens-gambit
```

## Usage

1. **Input Number of Queens:**
   - Enter the number of queens in the input box.

2. **Adjust Visualization Speed:**
   - Use the slider to change the speed.

3. **Start Visualization:**
   - Click "Play" to see the solutions unfold.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling the UI components.
- **JavaScript**: Implementing the interactive features and algorithm.

## Demo

Your result should to be same as the above screen shots.

## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?
-  1. Algorithm Optimization
Implementing the backtracking algorithm for solving the N-Queens problem taught valuable lessons in algorithm optimization. Iterative improvements in the algorithm's efficiency were necessary to handle larger board sizes without performance degradation.

-  2. UI/UX Design Iteration
Iterative UI/UX design was crucial to improve user interaction and visual clarity. Feedback loops from testing helped in refining the slider functionality and ensuring responsive design across different devices.
