# Queen's Gambit: N-Queens Visualiser

Queen's Gambit is a visualisation tool for solving the N-Queens problem using a backtracking algorithm. The N-Queens problem involves placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This project allows you to interactively explore and visualize solutions to the N-Queens problem.

## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?
-  1. Algorithm Optimization
Implementing the backtracking algorithm for solving the N-Queens problem taught valuable lessons in algorithm optimization. Iterative improvements in the algorithm's efficiency were necessary to handle larger board sizes without performance degradation.

-  2. UI/UX Design Iteration
Iterative UI/UX design was crucial to improve user interaction and visual clarity. Feedback loops from testing helped in refining the slider functionality and ensuring responsive design across different devices.
